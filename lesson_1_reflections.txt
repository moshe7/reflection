What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google docs mostly used for spared file, on the other hand git used for edit multiple file at once.
